/*
 * Point Wise curve representation.
 * Written by Bryce Summers on 2/8/2016
 *
 * Specifies a list of points that define a curve through interpolation over splines.
 * I will probably start by using something simple like ye old -A/16 + 9B/16 + 9C/16 - D/16 formula.
 * // FIXME: We might want to try using some other type of spline.
 * 
 * This class will also provide functionality for converting the representation to a 
 * 2D spline through a perspective projection of the points.
